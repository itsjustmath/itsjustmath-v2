# Cultivating (Collective) Creativity (Through Connection, Communityy)
## *Become [find?] (what it means to be) part of a community that encourages creativity.*

With the Oscars right around the corner, and Everything Everywhere All At Once (EEAAO) [breaking records](https://variety.com/2023/film/actors/everything-everywhere-breaks-record-most-wins-sag-awards-a24-1235536654/) at the Screen Actors Guild Awards last month, I was reminded of a couple recent interviews I'd seen where ~~the~~ actors discussed what it was about the atmosphere that their directors created that encouraged the cast and crew to do their best work.

Particularly in EEAAO's case — how a low budget, surrealist sci-fi (and it's cast) has become the front-runner for several of the top Oscar prizes.

**It made me think about the delicate nature of creativity, but more importantly, what can be accomplished collectively *and* individually in a safe environment where experimentation and vulnerability are encouraged.**

> The worst enemy of creativity is self-doubt. - Sylvia Plath

And as I try to start publishing more consistently ~~again~~, I'm creating work that I'm quite proud of, and when I finally share it with the world, crickets.

My Internet friend Salman [explains this struggle](https://salman.io/blog/low-stakes-strong-takes/) eloquently:
>  You imagined the inevitable moment when you would **dip the toes of *your little creation* into the vast ocean of the internet, helplessly watching its struggling strokes under the critical gaze of the world’s eye** as you completed the obligatory rituals, trumpeting its arrival on the channels of social media.
>
> **Would it sink at once, dying an invisible death, mourned only in your memories?**
>
> **Would it swim far enough to surpass the thrashing waves of algorithmic entry, and onto the judging jaws of trolling piranhas?**

That voice of self-doubt whispering in my ear that creating in isolation is lonely, sharing it with the world is scary, and I should just give because nobody cares — its reminded me that **creativity does not happen in a vacuum**. That human creativity requires a nourishing community. That ideas are delicate.

As Steve Jobs once said: "they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily just squished."

## The Most Dangerous Myth About Creativity: The "Lone Genius"

If creative flourishing is such a delicate act, and we're trying to encourage others to create as a way to explore who they are, and who we are in relation to others, then there couldn't be a more dangerous myth the that of the lone genius.

In [Show Your Work](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/),  Austin Kleon writes:
> If you believe in the lone genius myth, creativity is an antisocial act, performed by only a few a great figures mostly dead men with names like Mozart, Einstein, or Picasso. The rest of us are left to stand around and gawk in awe at their achievements.

But then Kleon goes on to suggest we pursue a healthier alternative, what Brian Eno coined a "**scenius**":

> Under this model, **great ideas are often birthed by a group of creative individuals**—artists, curators, thinkers, theorists, and other tastemakers—who make up **an "ecology of talent."**
>
> Many of the people who we think of as lone geniuses were actually part of **"a whole scene of people who were supporting each other, looking at each other's work, copying from each other, stealing ideas, and contributing ideas."**
>
> Being a valuable part of a scenius is [then] about what you have to contribute—**the ideas you share, the quality of the connections you make, and the conversations you start**.

~~*Human genius is not individual, it is shared.*~~ The essence of art is living, and sharing our stories. And through this human expression we can connect, encourage, and inspire others. Which brings me back to my earlier interview examples.

## ~~Cultivated Creativity in Cinema~~

### The EEAAO Cast on Working with "the Daniels"

EEAAO is ~~the ultimate~~ a wonderful example of *philosophy disguised as fiction*. The absurdity and outlandishness of the movie — the conceit of a multiverse, the pyrotechnics, the cinematic flourishing — all serve as a way to help the audience let our guard down so we can see real question that the movie asks of us: **‌how do we pay attention to the ones we love when the universe is trying to take that attention away from them?** [is this paragraph even needed?]

The actors in a film are the vessel for the script. And to get "the best" from your actors requires a [certain] level ~~of vulnerability —~~  them connecting with themselves, each other, the directors, and the audience. That connection with self and others requires vulnerability. Vulnerability requires a safe space to allow people to feel like they won’t be judged or rejected. ~~The carefully curated script of a film can only take it so far [and it says a lot that the actors are winning individual awards]~~

> **The Daniels are really good with hearing their actors thoughts or feedback. It is very much a collaborative process.**
>
> **Every scene has been thought out and composed** and **yet [they] allow you to play**. They have **created a situation** where **everybody should be more friendly and more creative** there's a real feeling of kindness **it's very intentional the way that everyone is cultivating a workspace that is full of joy**. - [EEAAO | Official Featurette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=81&v=A7DgDpURLRY&feature=youtu.be)

### Austin Butler on Working with Quentin Tarantino

Similarly I was struck by something Austin Butler said about working with Quentin Tarantino in a recent [Hot Ones interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=623&v=XgmTqdPd34Y&feature=youtu.be).

~~Quentin Tarantino is one who really needs no introduction. A director with a distinct cinematic signature that puts him among the likes of Michel Gondry, Wes Anderson, or Lars von Trier [any better examples?].~~  But what Austin said served as a wonderful(?) reminder that make movie magic "takes a village":

[should I just paraphrase this interview?]

> *Sean Evans*: is it true that Quentin Tarantino will often times request another take even if he has everything that he needs just because making movies kicks ass?
>
> *Austin Butler*: yeah [...] it's really awesome when you're on set the first time [...] and he says, **"okay we got it, but we're gonna do one more. You know why?"** And the entire crew screams **"because we love making movies!"**
>
And the first time you're there you kind of go "oh  you're not in on it?" and so Brad and Leo everybody's like because "we love making movies!"
>
> There are sets that are so sterile, there are sets where there's no joy, there are sets where people are like just at a job, and **you're trying to like create something that you're gonna give to the world** and **with Quentin** that was so cool because **it just changes the atoms in the room** and then the next time that "we love making movies" happens, now you're in on it. So **every new crew member or actor whoever then suddenly they're a part of the tribe** at that point saying "we love making movies!"

## To Create ~~(To Be Vulnerable)~~ Is To Connect

Serendipity on the internet only happens when we share our ideas with the world.  Every word, tweet, or essay you write is [a search query to find your people](https://escapingflatland.substack.com/p/search-query) — a signal to others about what is meaningful to you, and about how you want to connect.

For some, the fear of rejection ~~(or worse apathy)~~ outweighs the potential rewards of connection. Luckily, there are burgeoning communities (like Write of Passage) and platforms (like Substack) that are going to lay the groundwork for what it means to create, connect, and grow (individually and collectively) in the Internet age.

The Internet really just is a bunch of sceniuses divorced of physical geography, and devoid of traditional gatekeepers.

To create is to explore who we are, and to explore who we are in relation to others. Henry Miller once said, "part of the act of creating is in discovering your own kind."

What creations do *you* hope to share with others? Who do *you* want to connect with?
