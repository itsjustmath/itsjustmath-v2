## A Stand-up Guy

This past week, I was watching Jon Stewart [accepting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QzUu78IXU4) his 2022 Mark Twain Prize. He was discussing how he got his start in comedy at the Comedy Cellar, and I couldn't help but compare the platform that comedy club provided and the platform (and opportunity) that the Internet provides:

> I walked into a basement in Greenwich Village called the Comedy Cellar.
>
> And when you're a comic, **you look in a room, and 200 seats are facing one way**.
>
> **And there's one stool, and it has a light shining on it.**
>
> And you walk into that room, and go, "That's gonna be my chair. I'm gonna sit in that one."
>
> And **you spend the rest of your career trying to earn that stool.**
>
> And some nights, man, you don't even belong in the club, you don't even belong on the street.
>
> But you get back at it, because **there isn't any fixed point in comedy where you make it or you don't make it.**
>
> **It's the journey,** with the greatest friends I could ever possibly have made.

In the realm of creative expression, there is no fixed point when you've "made it", you have to just **keep at it**.

It's about the journey, showing up, and the incredible friends you make along the way.

## How "The Writing Studio" parallels the Comedy Cellar

This month I'm kicking off a series of 1:1 sessions with [Michael Dean](https://www.michaeldean.site/) for a writing accelerator that Write of Passage is running called "The Writing Studio". We are (aptly) going to be refining my recent essay about [finding friends and communities on the internet](https://itsjustmath.net/internet-friends).

I believe they ultimately want to curate and promote the writing that comes out of this new initiative. Could The Writing Studio become a springboard like the Comedy Cellar that gives writers a platform and a way to share and practice their material? I sure hope so.
