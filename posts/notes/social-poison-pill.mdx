There was a recent interview on The Verge where the president of Spotify [announced](https://www.theverge.com/23638082/spotify-redesign-gustav-soderstrom-tiktok-stream-podcasts-music-discovery) a TikTok-like UI is coming to their app.

It reminded me of Meta's similar decision last year (after investor pressure) to shift its product feature set (on both Facebook and Instagram) to mirror that of its new rival, one driven purely by algorithmic distraction.

Just as TikTok blew past the billion user mark (faster than any social platform before it had), there were reports that Meta's user growth had stalled, and [its value plummeted $200 billion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-owner-metas-stock-price-plunges-premarket-jolting-tech-investors-11643887542?mod=article_relatedinline) in a single day. Perhaps unironically, the subtitle of that same article said, "Shares of streaming giant Spotify also fall after disappointing subscriber outlook."

Not that they have a choice (once they've gone public or taken investor money), but when a tech company listens to investors instead of users, and moves away from their original value proposition, I believe that marks the beginning of the end for that platform.

Cal Newport has cleverly [called](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2022/08/01/tiktoks-poison-pill/) TikTok the poison pill for the social-media giants. Basically claiming that the shift towards algorithmic feeds[^feed] is the death knell of these digital dictators.

There is almost a blind faith that machines—call it artificial intelligence, or machine learning—are the antidote to this stalled [different word?] growth[^loving grace]. But in reality the actual utility of these platforms are going to wither as they take part in a [race to the bottom of the brain stem](https://twitter.com/tristanharris/status/1126697265152708609?lang=en).

In Meta's case, chasing TikTok meant its platforms started to move away from leveraging its [social graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_graph) to allow people to communicate with each other.
  
In Spotify's case, chasing TikTok might mean that it'll move away from it's seamless UI and ease of access towards something that requires active attention from the user.[^jacob] 

In both cases...



~~Youtube algorithm (home page isn't your subscriptions, its a AI-generated feed of recommended videos) — [find that story about youtube radicalizing people]~~
~~[maybe youtube is an outlier, but even they put out shorts]~~

~~I thought that Twitter might be the last bastion of hope for these aught-era social platforms — but since Elon scooped it up they have since rolled out (readily visible) tweet metrics.[^tweet metrics]~~ [not sure this is relevant enough to include]
~~[how to loop in vanity metrics?]~~
~~The first slippery slope (what's something I can compare this to that precedes a death knell?) was vanity metrics, Tik Tok style feeds are the death knell~~

> "If TikTok acts as the poison pill that finally cripples the digital dictators that for so long subjugated the web 2.0 revolution, we just might be left with more breathing room for smaller, more authentic, more human online engagements" (calnewport.com, TikTok’s Poison Pill - Study Hacks - Cal Newport)

some predictions for 2023 are that niche, decentralized social networks will emerge or  finally have their time to shine [find those prediction articles in readwise]

> "The next big thing in 2023 will be a new set of vertical-focused social platforms built to be "sufficiently decentralized. " Unlike the platforms before them, these businesses will guarantee that users own a direct relationship with their audience" (Nikhil Basu Trivedi, The Next Big Thing in 2023 Will Be...)

> "creators can leverage new tech to own their audiences. Ultimately, I believe all creators-turned-businesses will own their audiences through newsletters and personalized, subscription-based communities." (Scott Belsky, 9 Forecasts for the Near Future, With Implications)



I'd like to zero in on Neil Postman's comparison of George Orwell's “big brother” prophecy and Aldous Huxley's *very* different (and eerily prescient) view on the future.
> In Huxley’s vision...people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.
> 
> Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism [...] that we would become a trivial culture [because we] failed to take into account man’s almost infinite appetite for distractions.

Will we be able to pull ourselves out of this cultural free fall? Will these companies get increasingly better at pacifying and distracting us? Or will people finally get fed up with the shallow entertainment?

Will niche, decentralized social networks finally have their time to shine?



All hail the almighty algorithm? 


Ask for feedback? Mention Youtube being an outlier 

[^feed]: Have you ever thought about where the term "feed" comes from? I'll give you a couple hints: farm, and pig.
[^loving grace]: [link to clip of all watched over by machines of loving grace]
[^jacob]: My buddy Jacob put it well when he said, "I like Spotify most when I'm not looking at it". RIP passive consumption?
[^tweet metrics]: Important enough visually to be placed next core feature-set items like the reply, like & retweet buttons.
