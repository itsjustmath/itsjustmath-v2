# (Intro)

## (Introduce Problem[^introProblem])

[^intro] There's no doubt you've seen the headlines — *AI is here and it's coming for you and your {livelihood|job}. Its going to change **everything***.[^introNeedsMoreShockValue]. [Its hard to keep up with how fast technology seems to be evolving]

There are a lot of people up in arms about the latest {technology revolution}, artificial intelligence[^aiAka]. It seems like there is a great ~~{"mind work"}~~ reckoning happening. A {tidal wave} of change [^moreContext] that starting[^aiExamples] with artists, illustrators, content marketers — but will very soon inundate {most} white collar workers. The automation that's been affecting blue collar workers for decades is finally coming for {knowledge workers}[^kirbyBlue]. 

[^fearArgument] There is an {understandable} fear of losing control {to this black box of machine learning}, of being supplanted/replaced by the very thing we created[^frankenstein]. But in reality, technology has been [changing things, forcing people to adapt, "replacing"]  for centuries now — starting[^actualStart] with the printing press[^monkBooks].[^monks] And these recent technological innovations are ~~a natural~~ just the latest progression of that.[^onlydiff] Another tool in our arsenal, that can be used to amplify our innate human abilities.[^waitingTooLong]

[^betterConnector] ~~But~~ like so many technological advances that have come before, there {will arise} both *opportunity* and *risk* ~~{during this wild-west time for artificial intelligence}~~. There will be heretics warning of end-times, and sensationalist marketers gleefully claiming their new {bot} "will solve `[insert your problem]` better than has before, ~~cheaper, faster than *anything* that's come before it.~~" 

These technological advances—like those[^techAdvancesExamples] ~~that have come~~ before it—have the opportunity to be used to solve some of our most pressing problems[^problemsExample], or to level the playing field and create equitable access for anybody with a device, an internet connection, and a curiosity to learn.[^whatAccessEnables]  With each evolution there is an opportunity to disrupt existing power structures[^powerStructures], to dethrone these traditional ~~hierarchies and~~ gatekeepers.[^thisOneInParticular]

*But this is all far from guaranteed to happen*. With these new possibilities will come more cunning attempts to control, distract, and pacify us. ~~Marshall McLuhan said, "we shape our tools and then our tools shape us."~~ There is real risk here (but not that of Skynet[^skynet], and much more like that over Brave New World[^braveNewWorld]) of technological resources being averted to trivial, short-sighted, but scarily efficient cash grabs.[^raceToTheBottom]

[The opportunity will be there for those...]
[there will be a class of people who learn how to "hack the system"]

Regardless of which way things go ~~(the ship gets steered?), I can guarantee~~ you will need to adapt, or risk getting left behind. AI (and its eventual ~~subsequent~~ successors) are going to change the way we work, the way we consume media, and the way that we interact with technology. While this can seem daunting, I believe (and have seen that) there is real opportunity here for those who {learn the ropes|push the boundaries} and seize it.

~~[I'm going to show you some of examples of technology already changing things (in good and bad ways), and also talk about some of the traditional institutions they have already begun to dismantle/weaken]~~


*Is this an article about technological advances, or about AI? Should they be broken into separate articles?*


[^introProblem]: [i.e. machines taking over]
[^intro]: Use the intro as a way to *alarm* & pull the reader in. Maybe could talk about that healthcare system using AI and automatically rejecting everybody, or that quote from that CEO about how AI determines if you're getting into a job interview long before a human ever does.
[^frankenstein]: image of frankenstein to illustrate point?
[^onlydiff]: The difference now is that it risks getting totally out of our control (much more of a blackbox thing happening)
[^introNeedsMoreShockValue]: Elaborate here, really going for shock value. *Maybe find more alarmist/dystopian headlines?*. This is an opportunity to have some fun with the writing. (Passing bar exam?)
[^aiAka]: aka "AI"
[^moreContext]: need more context as to what the tidal wave entails? (Or should I just do that in subsequent paragraphs?
[^aiExamples]: Give examples of the various image generators (Dall-E, etc)
[^kirbyBlue]: "Any mind work that can get automated will get automated blue collar workers have been living this for decades now it's white collar workers turn" - Kirby Ferguson, AI and Image Generation
[^fearArgument]: I'm (maybe, eventually/later on) going to argue that this shouldn't be the real fear, it's really going to be about what happens when capitalists get their hands on it
[^monks]: midjourney image of monks copying books by hand
[^braveNewWorld]: pull in quote from my other essay about people "loving their oppression"
[^monkBooks]: Monks used to painstakingly hand-copy books. Which could take anywhere from 6 months to a *whole year* for just one book. This made books (and by extension knowledge and education) largely inaccessible to majority of people, except the ruling classes and religious institutions.
[^actualStart]: did it actually *start* here though?
[^waitingTooLong]: Am I waiting too long to get into the potential upside?
[^betterConnector]: maybe a need a better / more explicit connector of "AI" and how that plays into the overall "tech tools" topic of the essay
[^techAdvancesExamples]: The internet, the silicon chip, smartphones
[^problemsExample]: Like reviewing large datasets to catch patterns and anomalies that a human never could (breast cancer example)
[^whatAccessEnables]: They can improve productivity, open the doors of possibility to those with disabilities, help with learning/education, media literacy. *It also allows people to create, share, tell stories more easily and with less resources.*
[^thisOneInParticular]: This one (AI) in particular seems like it could be used solve our most pressing problems (climate change, depletion of resources, sickness), we could do more to ensure our species continued survival and evolution
[^powerStructures]: Things that are desperately outdated or are ripe for competition, innovation (like the entrenched, legacy educational institutions)
[^skynet]: In the Terminator movies, Skynet (a fictional AI) becomes self-aware and decides humans are threat to it's existence, so it tries to annihilate them.
[^raceToTheBottom]: Tristan Harris' oft-quoted, "race to the bottom of the brainstem".
