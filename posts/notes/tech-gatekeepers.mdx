# (Intro)

## (Introduce Problem[^introProblem])

[^intro] There's no doubt you've seen the headlines — *AI is here and it's coming for you and your {livelihood|job}. Its going to change **everything***.[^introNeedsMoreShockValue].

There are a lot of people up in arms about the latest {technology revolution}, artificial intelligence[^aiAka]. It seems like there is a great ~~{"mind work"}~~ reckoning happening. A {tidal wave} of change [^moreContext] that starting[^aiExamples] with artists, illustrators, content marketers — but will very soon inundate {most} white collar workers. The automation that's been affecting blue collar workers for decades is finally coming for {knowledge workers}[^kirbyBlue]. 

[^fearArgument] There is an {understandable} fear of losing control {to this black box of machine learning}, of being supplanted/replaced by the very thing we created[^frankenstein]. But in reality technology has been [changing things, forcing people to adapt, "replacing"]  for centuries now — starting with the printing press destroying [^monks]

[but technology has been doing this "replacing" for a long time, and this is just another "natural" progression in  that[^onlydiff]]

[I'm going to argue that there is actual opportunity here]
[But also risk, but not the risk you might think[^braveNewWorld]]

*AI & deepfakes?*

[TK: Technology has the potential to dismantle many of the traditional (stuck in the old ways) gatekeepers]

[TK: Things that need to go or are desperately outdated or are ripe for competition, innovation (like the entrenched, legacy educational institutions)]

[^introProblem]: [machines taking over]
[^intro]: Use the intro as a way to *alarm* & pull the reader in
[^frankenstein]: image of frankenstein to illustrate point?
[^onlydiff]: The difference now is that it risks getting totally out of our control (much more of a blackbox thing happening
[^introNeedsMoreShockValue]: Elaborate here, really going for shock value. *Maybe find more alarmist/dystopian headlines?*
[^aiAka]: aka "AI"
[^moreContext]: need more context as to what the tidal wave entails? (Or should I just do that in subsequent paragraphs?
[^aiExamples]: Give examples of the various image generators (Dall-E, etc)
[^kirbyBlue]: "Any mind work that can get automated will get automated blue collar workers have been living this for decades now it's white collar workers turn" - Kirby Ferguson, AI and Image Generation
[^fearArgument]: I'm (maybe, eventually/later on) going to argue that this shouldn't be the real fear, it's really going to be about what happens when capitalists get their hands on it
[^monks]: midjourney image of monks copying books by hand
[^braveNewWorld]: pull in quote from my other essay about people "loving their oppression"
